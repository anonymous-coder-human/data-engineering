# Data Engineer Exercise

## Pre-flight instructions
To run this code download pandas from pip and then run the main.py file
(The exploratory.py file is unnecessary and was a tool I used to explore the data.)

`pip install pandas>=1.3.1`

`python3 main.py`

The output will be stored in the directory where the main.py file is run.
The main.py script was successfully tested with python 3.10 and pandas 1.5.3 as well as python 3.7 and pandas 1.3.1
Because of that It is very likely that it will run with many other combinations of python 3 and pandas

## Documentation
There is a documentation file for main.py in the documentation folder called main.html
There you can easily view all the code and documentation in the browser of your choosing

## Future Extensibility
Modifications to change the download URLS or the output file names are made very simple by the code structure used here.
It will also be easy to extract data from more complex sources and/or load data in forms other than a csv by only modifying the behavior of specific functions.
